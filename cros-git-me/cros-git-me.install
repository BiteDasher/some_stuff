	This package is permanently work-in-progress while Crostini
	is in beta. Missing features, issues and bugs are possible!

	Developed and tested on Google Pixelbook, but should work 
	fine on other Chromebooks/Chromeboxes with Crostini enabled. 

	Please report any issues to the AUR page!

	(!) Manual actions required:

	1. Check if ~/.config/pulse directory is present. If not, execute
	   cp -r /etc/skel/.config/pulse ~/.config

	Restart Crostini after package was installed/updated and manual actions were done!
